# ‚ö° MongoTShock

What is MongoTShock? MongoTShock is my attempt at creating a modern successor to TShock. What are we aiming to do here? I'll fill you in:
- Create a backwards-compatible ecosystem, allowing ALL TShock, or at least most TShock plugins to work with little-to-no effort
- Allow MongoDB utilization. This will be MongoTShock's primary and only form of data storage, asides from json of course. It is faster, easier to develop with, and allows for hot-editing. This means reloading will be required less often.
- Provide general fixes and better systems on top of TShock's existing systems such as: bans, regions, etc.
- Actively maintain this project. Unlike TShock, we will be actively listening to the community and working towards building a properly maintained product.
- Attempts at providing a faster, more light-weight, less memory-heavy alternative to TShock.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependencies:

We are building off TShock, so everything that was required from TShock.


## üìú WIP

This is a heavily WIP project. I just started working on it so expect it to take a while. If you'd like to contribute or assist in development, feel free to submit a pull request. Let's make something awesome! :D
